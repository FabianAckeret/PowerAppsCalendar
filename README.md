# PowerAppsCalendar

This calendar component is based off the calendar component [published by April Dunnam](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faprildunnam%2FPowerApps%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FComponents%2FCalendar%2520Component%2520%284%29.msapp&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3RVUjlqbmJud0hJLWt5MzJMSUJxdmV5emJQUXxBQ3Jtc0tsc254TERjbUx0and3N1pTcUJLSE82N21vUUc1dHdXb3RsVHFBNHp6a3JJZDJEclNIdTBYNU8wZUNqZjRaQWtoQ19nb1FRcUhLOXU4c2VQdlJfZ1VCUTBkWFlLU0NPSFd0MWlsWnk0aTkzTk1HQnAwUQ%3D%3D&v=pl1YoItT1VM). I don't take credit for it! 
My adjustments to this calendars include

- Responsive-friendly (not 100% responsive yet, but quite close)
- Re-arrangement of controls at the top
- Replaced "today" with an icon. Making it easier for smaller screens
- Fixed todays text color
- Re-arranged month-switcher
- some minor changes
